# JavaScript REPLs

Have you ever been tired of setting up development enviroment before you could write just a simple "Hello World!" program in a new discovered language? Fear no more! Most programming languages come with REPL (read-eval-print-loop) tools and so do the JavaScript.

The most common but not so well known REPL for JS is the DevTools - just open it with F12 and type some code - it will be evaluated and the result printed out. Want you to try new language features, not yet available in the current browsers? Let's explore some possibilities.


## JavaScript

### Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transpile new language features to the common ES5 format which can be run in most browsers. There is also an [online REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/) which allows you to view the output code.

### repl.it

[browser](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)

[node.js](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs)

### node-repl


## Haskell

### ghci

### repl.it
